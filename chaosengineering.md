# Chaos engineering 
 * Chaos Engineering involves injecting faults into system
 * It helps to find risks address them before they more significant
    * Discover reliability risks before they cause outages.
    * Recreate past incidents and outages to verify resiliency mechanisms.
    * Validate runbooks and training teams to respond to incidents in a controlled environment.
    * Reduce risks in large-scale initiatives, such as cloud migrations.
    * Reduce revenue-impacting downtime.
 * Chaos Engineering is a preventative practice
