### Site Reliability Engineering 
Its fills the gaps between developers,operations, and administration 
* Collaboration
* Integration

DevOps Key principles
* Collaboration between development and operation communication
* Feedback loops
* DevOps pipeline(Build, Test and Deploy)
  
**.Plan/Dev/Build**
   * Shift left model
      *  Shift Left Testing
      *  Shift Left Security

Principles of Site Reliability Engineering   
Mean time to Failure(MTTF)   
Mean time to Repair(MTTR}

SRE
* Minimize errors and failures
* Try to minimize the cost
* operations in right direction
  

Devops
* Accepts the failures
* Gradual changes  

**DevOps Research and Assessment(DORA) Matrics**
* Deployment Frequency--> Low Medium  High
* Lead time for Changes--> Low Medium  High
* Time to restore service -->Low Medium  High
* Change failure rate-->Low Medium  High

**Service Level Indicators(SLI)**
* Request Latency
* Error rate
* System throughput
* Availability
* Yield
* Durability

**Service Level objectives(SLO)**

**Service Level Agreement(SLA)**

**Measuring Service Risk**
* Performance
* Improvemens
* Degradations

**SRE Service Life cycle**
 * Architecture & Design
 * Development
 * Limited availability
 * General availability
 * Deprecation

**SRE Impact Measuring**
 * Impact
 * Maturity matix
 * Re-evaluation

**Blameless Postmortem Culture Creation**

** Premortem---> 1.Imagine Failures 2.Work backwards

 **Key Activites**  
     * Analyze scenarios  
     * Determine likelihood  
     * Take preventative actions   
**key Best Practices**
  * Avoid Generalizations.
  * Capture practical and actionable points
  * Consider impact on existing plans
**Postmortem Culture**
* Document learnings
* Disseminate learnings
* Constructive feedback
* Improvement and resilience
* Iterative and collaborative process
* Benefits of Postmortem
   * Share across organization
   * Conduct cross team reviews
   * Hold tranining Excercises
   * Implement weekly reporting 

**Observability** -->Monitoring,Logging and Tracing 
* Pillars of Observability--> Metrics,Logs,Traces

**Event** -->Time stamped   
**Metrics**-->Measured over a time interval  
**Traces**-->Visualize the Jounery of request or transaction
Distributed Tracing 

**Production Readiness Review(PRR)**
* Service level factors
  * Service-Level Indiciator--->Identtify SLI
  * Service-Level Objective--->Measure SLO
  * Service-Level agreement -->Create Service level agreements
* PRR Analysis
  * Service Investigation
  * Checklist Creation
    * General information
    * Development process
    * Architecture
    * Change management
    * Capacity planning
    * Observability
    * Incident response 
  * Identify Deficiencies
  * Refactoring
    * Code review
    * Code analysis
    * Code formatting

** Onboarding process**
 * Operations management
 * Change Management
 * Access management
 * Backup and recovery management
