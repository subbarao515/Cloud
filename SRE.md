### Site Reliability Engineering 
Its fills the gaps between developers,operations, and administration 
* Collaboration
* Integration

DevOps Key principles
* Collaboration between development and operation communication
* Feedback loops
* DevOps pipeline(Build, Test and Deploy)
  
**.Plan/Dev/Build**
   * Shift left model
      *  Shift Left Testing
      *  Shift Left Security

Principles of Site Reliability Engineering   
Mean time to Failure(MTTF)   
Mean time to Repair(MTTR}

SRE
* Minimize errors and failures
* Try to minimize the cost
* operations in right direction
  

Devops
* Accepts the failures
* Gradual changes  

**DevOps Research and Assessment(DORA) Matrics**
* Deployment Frequency--> Low Medium  High
* Lead time for Changes--> Low Medium  High
* Time to restore service -->Low Medium  High
* Change failure rate-->Low Medium  High

**Service Level Indicators(SLI)**
* Request Latency
* Error rate
* System throughput
* Availability
* Yield
* Durability

**Service Level objectives(SLO)**
**Service Level Agreement(SLA)**
