### Site Reliability Engineering 
Its fills the gaps between developers,operations, and administration 
* Collaboration
* Integration

DevOps Key principles
* Collaboration between development and operation communication
* Feedback loops
* DevOps pipeline(Build, Test and Deploy)
  
**.Plan/Dev/Build**
   * Shift left model
      *  Shift Left Testing
      *  Shift Left Security

Principles of Site Reliability Engineering   
Mean time to Failure(MTTF)   
Mean time to Repair(MTTR}

SRE
* Minimize errors and failures
* Try to minimize the cost
* operations in right direction
* 

Devops
* Accepts the failures
* Gradual changes
*
